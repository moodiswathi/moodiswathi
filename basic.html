    <h1>Display property example</h1>
    <div>A general-purpose input/output (GPIO) is an uncommitted digital signal pin on an integrated circuit or 
     electronic circuit (e.g. MCUs/MPUs) board which may be used as an input or output, or both, and is 
    controllable by software. GPIOs have no predefined purpose and are unused by default.
